# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical parameters.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv`, which contains patient data such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Serum Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- Target (0: No disease, 1: Disease)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, StandardScaler, etc.)

## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Data Visualization
3. Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
4. Model Building using Logistic Regression
5. Performance Evaluation (Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
6. ROC-AUC Curve Plotting

## üìà Results

The model provides an effective way to predict heart disease risk based on patient attributes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and ROC curve are used to measure performance.
